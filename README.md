# Salary Estimation 
Project Goals:

Salary Prediction: Develop a machine learning model to predict salaries for data-related jobs in the United States based on key factors such as job title, company location, and company rating. This will provide salary insights to help job seekers and employers make informed decisions.

Satisfaction Classification: Classify whether a predicted salary is satisfactory or not, considering factors like job title, company reviews, and location. This classification will assist job seekers in evaluating compensation fairness and making better career choices.
